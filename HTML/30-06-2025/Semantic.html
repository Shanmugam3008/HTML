				<P><b>Learning</b> is <i>the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences</i>.The ability to learn is possessed by humans, non-human animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event <u>(e.g. being burned by a hot stove)</u>, but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.</p>
