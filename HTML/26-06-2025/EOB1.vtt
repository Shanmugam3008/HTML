00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.960
The world was divided

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.710
into the East and the West.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.240
This is a cold war of the 2 sides.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.030
A military boundary
located in the Pacific,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.770
Country J,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.370
which used to be a economic giant,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.790
now is troubled by polarization
and lack of resources.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.100
And there're complicated
deals in the dark,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.940
taking aim at politics,
religions or racism.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.330
This kind of countries

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.820
are vulnerable to spies

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.000
who hold the destiny of both sides.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.430
Please.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.570
Natural and unprocessed steak.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.750
It's scorched!

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.790
I want it to be halfraw and bloody.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.010
You're right.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.140
The blood is not enough.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.920
I'll get you another one.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.510
It's not necessary.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.960
Now the problem has been solved.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.100
Hey.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.130
Fetch that girl.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.200
You are always wound up like this...

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.930
No weapon, right?

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.030
Come here.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.370
A new face, hmm?

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.960
I've just come to this street.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.850
Then let me teach you something.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.510
Butterfly,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.770
go to the morgue.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.720
Don't be angry.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.130
You are my only love.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520
I know...

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.570
Stinger.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.780
I've tried many kinds of women...

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.980
But none of them is like you.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.070
You got me high.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.590
I don't mind anyway.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.830
Hey...

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.910
What's the whole "morgue" thing?

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.370
A place where there're
people in pieces.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.060
Refugees from the East are
increasing these years.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.280
They steal money on the
pretext of life saving,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.970
biochemical companies use them
as materials of human experiment.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.570
They kill two birds with one stone.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.410
Who the hell are you?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.360
A spy from the West?

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.300
Or the East...?

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.800
No point in pretending.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.560
What a pity.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.030
Impossible.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.740
Where did you hide the weapon…

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.250
What

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.560
is your name…

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.210
009-1

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.310
Come!

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.590
Rank B.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.610
Rank B.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680
Rank A.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.560
Kids' organs always sell well.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.220
Rank B.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.730
Rank D.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.530
You've been discarded.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.270
Keep quiet!

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.860
Keep quiet!

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.540
You are late...

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.670
Bitch...

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.880
What have you done to Stinger?

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.760
You'll go to the hell after him!

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.150
Bitch!

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.580
Be quick!

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200
Just run!

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.850
Go to the hell!

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.520
Monster.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.750
What's your name?

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.290
00 Department, the J branch.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.580
I remember nothing.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.840
I just know that when I
escaped from the East,

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.150
I lost my brother and mother before
being taken to the facilities here.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.350
Chosen by 00 Department,
a secret service of the government,

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.980
I was trained to become a spy.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.600
To make me a perfect one

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.260
they put 7 secret tools in my body

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.660
then I became a mechanical
spy beyond humanity.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.760
9-1, 020 wants to see you.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.560
9-1

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.790
Your next mission

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.520
is to rescue our head of the
West, Dr.Clyne.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.470
43 minutes ago, spies from the East got
in a biochemical research facility.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.790
Failing to kidnap the doctor,
they got trapped there.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:33.840
Clyne is in charge of Project
Faust, a top secret.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.870
She must be saved.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.700
I have a question.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.900
What?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.590
What's Project Faust?

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.020
It's about the mass
production of super humans

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.350
and you are part of this plan.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.990
In other words...

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.130
Dr.Clyne is like your mother.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.770
My mother?

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.200
What's wrong, 9-1?

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:10.940
Nothing.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.280
It's quiet for now.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.120
Got it, keep supervising.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.300
Center, please answer me...
haven't they come?

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.950
Why don't they just
send someone to get us?

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.910
I think you are abandoned.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.110
Shut the fuck up.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.770
We fight for the great motherland
and our intimate comrades.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.410
Our motherland will
never abandon us.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.560
Here you are,
Miss Spy from 00 Department.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.760
How are things going here?

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.579
Clyne and the spies are in the room
on the right side of the second floor

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.230
but the security system of
the institute is still on.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.600
It's very hard to get in.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.090
I know.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.670
Hey!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.510
Are you going alone?

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.310
What's the problem?

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.590
You are too confident.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.170
The rumour seems to be true...

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.240
You are not a simple human,

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.670
but a monster.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.170
What about this rumour?

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.759
A man will be with her forever
once he has slept with her.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.250
She can possibly be a monster.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.880
She's faster than us
as we've been trained!

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.310
Mechanical spy from the West...

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.390
I thought they didn't even exist.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.900
This is the center.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.530
This is Shadow.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.850
Mayday mayday,
we're fighting against the enemy!

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.040
The mission is over,
no rescue, that's all.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.940
Our motherland has abandoned us.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:32.850
It can't be!

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.900
It can't be!

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960
It can't be!

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.070
It can't be!

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.860
At your service, Dr.Clyne.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.100
I heard from 020 that...

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.540
Dr.Clyne is like your mother.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.900
You are my… You are so late.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.819
What are you doing?

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.230
Do not waste any life.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.510
Our lives never belong to ourselves.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.190
We get abandoned once we're useless.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.990
This is the destiny of spies.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.020
You're the same!

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.740
It's a waste of time.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.870
Don't show me a facial expression
like that, you just a tool.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.220
Destroy the lab. It has been known
by our enemy, though it's good.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.810
Keep the backup of our data,
and deal with the rest.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.839
Yes, madam, give me 2 hours...

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840
Just one hour.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.970
Let's start with the sample,
it needs to be transported.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.130
So this is the sample?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.490
Doctor...

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.220
He's a Eastern refugee
whom I rescued last night.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.360
I know.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.420
So with whom did
Stinger do business?

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.540
He had unreasonable demands and
took advantage of our difficulties

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.910
so he got taken down.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.660
Scientists are so cruel.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160
Leave this to me.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.150
Sure, Miss Agent.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.190
Could you tell me your name?

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:44.930
My name...

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.780
Nothing...

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.090
I remember nothing.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.320
Chris.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.940
Chris?

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.320
Is this my name?

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.450
I just made it up.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.400
Because your eyes are
as beautiful as crystal.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.700
I have a request.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.380
Let me listen to that song again.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.070
Which can calm me down...

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:36.870
Of course.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.830
Where are you going?

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.060
It's alright, I'll be back.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.010
Don't fear, nothing to fear.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:35.330
Stay still!

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.900
Another monster?

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:23.960
Nothing to fear, good
night, sweet dreams.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.750
We're the same?

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.040
Don't fear, nothing to fear.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.390
Chris.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.620
Let me go!

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.380
Mama!

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.070
My sister!

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.370
No, please don't take him.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.740
The bullet went through,
but did not hit vital parts.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.170
What are you doing? Let me go!

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.260
The roof...

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.170
Stop moving around this time.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.270
It's dangerous!

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.540
Mama!

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.180
Are you hurt?

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.450
Koto! Koto! Koto!

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.290
Monster.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.850
I'm a... monster.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.420
What is this place?

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.460
My room, don't worry.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.420
You saved me?

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:12.790
Thanks.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.760
Tell me your name.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.290
Mirine.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.320
Mirine, what a nice name.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.060
Are you sad?

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.670
Your heart is crying.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.540
I lost my memories too.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.130
I don't even know how my
family members look like.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.990
Not to mention myself.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.910
So we suffered the same fate.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.640
Let's find the them together!

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.720
Our lost memories.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:23.860
The real ourselves.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.280
We get them back together, Mirine.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.460
Okay.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.830
Together...

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:37.490
You promise?

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.240
I promise!

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.810
Good.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.810
Why didn't you report
to me immediately?

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:57.570
Sorry.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.620
The reason why I'm so disappointed.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.440
You're supposed to know it.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.010
Why didn't you go
after the enemy then?

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.090
If you did,

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.730
the doctor would not
have been taken away.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.530
He was wounded.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.680
Joke?

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.690
I'm really serious.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.960
You will be deprived
of your 00 number.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.490
Mirine Hoffman.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.720
The other eight 00 agents
will take over your mission.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.930
You're not one of us anymore.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.580
What a pity...

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:19.080
Bye, monster.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.800
We get abandoned once we're useless.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.570
This is the destiny of spies.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.610
You are the same!

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.120
I'm not a tool that you can
abandon whenever you want.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:05.400
The traitor is still
running, everyone, find her!

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.700
Chris!

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.160
No!

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.270
Here!

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.760
Yes yes.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.390
Everything is going as planned.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.260
That's it.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.750
Don't show me a facial expression
like that, you just a tool.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.950
You're not just a human...

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.760
but a monster.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.130
Bye, monster.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.800
Monster! Monster!

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.790
Tell me...

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.040
Who am I?

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.700
Mama.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680
Let's find them together.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.780
Our lost memories.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.080
The real ourselves.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.330
We get them back together, Mirine.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200
You promise?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I promise!

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.100
Promise…

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.730
Let me tell you where the
one you're looking for is.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.490
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.700
What would you like?

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:14.770
Dry Martiny.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.090
Anything else?

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.310
The map of area D is really here?

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:44.650
Don't worry.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.370
The host of the party,
Alan Lau, owns the map.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.660
How to get it?

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.070
By playing chess with Lau.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.209
And your body will be the bet.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.210
So it is.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.580
I get it, Sherry.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.450
Don't underestimate your
opponent, Mirine.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:20.240
It has been a long time since the
last opponent made me so serious.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:31.350
Even if a little, I want to
taste the thrilling moment.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.140
We're running out of time.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.150
My victory.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.120
Now give me the thing.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.010
This it is.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.380
This military facility
used to be funded a lot.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.989
Profits were good

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.150
but now it has become ruins.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.220
Totally useless.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.800
Why are you so interested in this?

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.300
To be honest, I'm crazy about ruins.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.950
The game is over, give it to me.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:51.930
Smell it.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.100
It smells so good.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:03.920
Smells like money.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:12.030
Okay!

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.670
Tell me the truth.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.250
Who are you?

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.370
None of your business.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.240
I want the Blondie over there.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.180
You can never fool my eyes.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.360
Monster!

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:06.900
Get the fuck up!

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:12.960
Perfect.

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:47.320
Bitch!

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.220
You killed Stinger!

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.840
So you understand the feeling of
losing the most important person?

00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:58.790
Of course I do.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.280
You're lying!

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.880
How can such a monster understand?

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.930
Die!

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.580
What's wrong?

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.100
It's unusual.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.410
It's usual.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.890
This is my home.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:55.390
Please come.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.810
Sherry,
00 Department is tracking me.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.249
It'll be dangerous to you, too.

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:05.330
What are you talking about?

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:09.040
I should thank you for making
me alive like this now.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.950
I wanna repay.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:12.570
Sherry.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:15.570
I'll try my best.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:25.780
Welcome back, Sherry!

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.239
Kai, you still a good boy
today, right?

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.100
Yeah.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.100
Really?

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:31.850
We have a guest.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.620
Nice to meet you. I'm Mirine.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.450
Hi, Mirine.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.439
Hey, head down!

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.440
It hurts.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.780
Oh no, what're you doing?

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.090
Don't touch me.

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:43.970
Why?

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:45.960
I'm gonna eat!

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.069
It's scalding, be careful.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:49.070
Right.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400
Oh my god!

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.089
Hey, are you alright?

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:53.310
Your hand?

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:53.970
You're fooled.
Your hand?

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:54.970
You're fooled.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.840
How dare you to fool your sister!

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.799
Why you needed to do that?

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.889
Interesting!

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:02.839
Interesting?

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.440
Interesting!

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.540
Mirine?

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.620
Or me?

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.000
Blow before eating it.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:10.560
Listen, take my fist next time.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.320
Yes.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:21.370
Mirine, why do you think
Dr.Clyne is in Area D?

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.460
That's where the signal of
her was located last time.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.820
So it is.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:33.720
Then the reason why are you trying to
find her even though 00 is tracking you?

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.780
She may know something
about my past.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.010
Your past?

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.520
I must find myself back.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:49.430
I made a promise.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.960
Thank you to make him asleep.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.900
I'm going out.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.560
After this finishes

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.769
I'll resign from the
intelligence department

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:33.220
and live a normal life with Kai.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.480
So must get back here alive.

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.300
Together with you.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.050
This is... Area D.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:09.330
This way.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.280
What's wrong?

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.690
Where are you going?

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.420
Mirine!

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.730
Mama.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.580
Mama.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:18.350
Sherry! Sherry?

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.700
The room...

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.210
In my dreams...

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.480
Mama!

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:24.699
Stop!

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.620
Mirine!

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:39.110
Mama...

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:41.120
Hey, mama!

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:44.250
Mama!

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:56.740
Are you awake?

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.240
Your chest gun has been locked.

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:04.460
Slack the enemy unarmedly, then win.

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.210
That's your ace.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.730
Who's it, show up...

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:36.190
Don't fear.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.290
Nothing to fear.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.659
Good night, sweet dreams.

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:46.780
Good night, sweet dreams.

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:00.730
Yes.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.480
Milliam was made from the
prototype of your mama.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.160
Who is it?

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:09.390
Show up!

00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:16.810
Chris?

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.990
I thought you're dead.

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:20.820
I pretended to be.

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:23.580
This is the drama that I edited.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:47.090
Why?

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:49.810
To get your memories back.

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:51.970
My... memories?

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.070
I've always been believing that.

00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:58.400
Old and depressing emotions
can make you recall something.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.460
So I got close to you

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.840
then helped you recall things

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.410
with extreme anger and hatred.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.890
You should have jumped on
those who mechanized you.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.690
Let's change the world together.

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.410
My sister.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.100
Mirine, you such a cheater.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640
Paul.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.970
Finally, my sister.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.220
You are still alive?

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080
The same as you.

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:52.800
Raised in the East as an agent,

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:58.100
then I used my hands to
bring my family back to life.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440
Family?

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:03.470
It is my hatred that has
been supporting me a lot

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.860
to revenge on those who
took my family away.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.780
That's why I made this plan

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.200
to revenge on the whole world.

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.070
Kidnapping Dr.Clyne is
also part of the plan.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:22.240
Setting up a powerful rocket force,
sending them to both the East and West...

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.870
Then a full-scale war will begin.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:33.160
A new world will arise
in the ash of the old.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.310
It's wrong!

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.140
Where's Dr.Clyne? Let her go.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.780
I refuse.

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:00.490
Wake up, Paul.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.270
A full-scale war will send
many people to the hell.

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:08.650
Many will lose their love like us.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.380
You're right.

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:13.080
But, this is the only way.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.920
The world is ready to be destroyed.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.670
Then you and me
should share one body.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:21.980
One body?

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.600
Of course, a perfect organism.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.820
We share the same body,
then become an ultimate family

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:44.180
in order to combine us forever.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.500
Paul, you're nuts!

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.850
Why can't you just understand?

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:54.060
Nobody will stop this plan.

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.580
I will!

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.330
You still insist even
if you know this?

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.589
The orphans,
after being trained to be an agent

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:07.490
with knowledge,
will power and sound judgement

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:09.350
they got mechanized.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.950
This is all about 00 number

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:16.120
but they died one by one
because of reject reaction.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.020
My sister,
you're the only successful one.

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:28.450
Bullshit.

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:30.460
There're 9 mechanical agents.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.400
Everyone's working
for 00 Department.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.960
Have you actually seen them before?

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.320
Your kind.

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:45.730
See?

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.010
Mirine, you are the only
monster in this world.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.540
Then projects about robots were stopped.
They spent a lot, but gained little

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:03.400
so they turned to undead soldiers
made by controlling gene.

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:05.010
Is that it?

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.420
You are right.

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:16.480
Dr.Clyne...

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.720
Why did you sell
your research to him?

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:24.620
Meeting my curiosity is the
most important thing to me.

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:26.090
That's all.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.120
Don't show me a facial expression
like that, you just a tool.

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:35.180
Antiques like you should
all have been eliminated.

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.250
What about shutting you down again?

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.660
Look.

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:52.520
These are my new
tools, Undead Mutants.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.120
Sherry!

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.110
She's a nice lab mouse.

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:29.800
What have you done?!

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.060
This is unforgivable, Dr.Clyne.

01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.130
So rampant? Kill her!

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.230
So my sister is really awesome!

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:22.520
Undead Mutants can do more!

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:51.890
No matter how these
tools get damaged,

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.930
they will always get up again!

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.440
But they feel painful.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:05.960
I'm suffering, help!

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:09.670
Kill me, release me!

01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:11.310
So what?

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:16.890
They can go on fighting even
they're in pieces or shot.

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.820
Such tools.

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:23.150
I wanna go home.

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:25.710
Sherry...

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.960
I wanna get back to Kai.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.560
How ugly.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.540
What?

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.330
Your enemy is over there.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.240
Stop!

01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:06.770
It's me who made you!

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.290
I'm like your mother!

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:13.020
Now Mirine's mission has finished.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.930
Dr.Clyne is dead.

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:19.090
Then she gets her lost past
and the real herself back.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:24.390
Congratulations.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.720
To meet our promise,

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360
I ask you again.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:32.510
Share your body with me

01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:36.840
to become a perfect organism
and an eternal life.

01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:39.070
You'll only get the same answer.

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:41.030
Paul, you're wrong.

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:42.580
I'll stop you!

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:47.030
Then I have to force you.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.060
Kill me.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.420
It hurts.

01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:33.930
Release me!

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:38.570
Oh my god.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.579
Are you alright?

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:40.970
After this finishes

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.309
I'll resign from the
intelligence department

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:45.700
and live a normal life with Kai.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:49.530
Kill me.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120
Mirine.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440
Kill me!

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:22.370
Thank you.

01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:28.680
Take care of Kai for me.

01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:01.300
I finally get it.

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.440
The reason why I became a monster

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.880
is to finish the crazy world.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.650
So I'll never be at a loss.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.530
It seems that your
heart is out of control.

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:41.430
So...

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.290
at least, I want your body.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.000
Mama, go after me.

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:42.470
So slow.

01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:38.900
Great, you can really deal with such
a strong enemy like mama till now.

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:04.130
My sister.

01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.020
Why are you going against me?

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.480
Why?!

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.020
Mirine.

01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:37.350
I love you.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040
It's like...

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.040
The past…

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.630
Our family...

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.960
Mama.

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:06.510
I love you too.

01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:08.870
Paul.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.190
Don't fear, nothing to fear.

01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:27.430
Paul,

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160
as you said,

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.410
those who start conflicts
should be hated.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.980
I'll fight against them.

01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:17.780
You've really done it,
you deserve to be called a monster.

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.379
I've fetched Dr.Clyne.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:36.380
This?

01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:40.190
A life-saving device
keeps all her brain cells.

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:43.010
All the data of Project
Faust is in this.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.020
My mission is to fetch
the "head" of the West.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720
Isn't it?

01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:53.850
I'll report to the
commission of investigation

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.200
but there're still rules.

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.030
At least prepare to be punished.

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.760
9-1

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.680
Bye.

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:13.050
And...

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.520
it's about Sherry's brother
that you took back here.

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.010
He's been accepted by the
facility and taken good care of.

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:26.170
To train him as a future spy?

01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:28.050
Anything wrong?

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:29.570
No.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.570
It has nothing to do with me.

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:42.050
She finished the mission as planned

01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:45.710
and became a perfect
mechanical agent.

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:48.800
009-1

01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:52.970
Someday she might change the world

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.750
as you planned.

01:23:56.670 --> 01:23:57.670
Number Zero.
