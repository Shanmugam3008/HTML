			<P><b>Learning</b> is <i>the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences</i>.The ability to learn is possessed by humans, non-human animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event <u>(e.g. being burned by a hot stove)</u>, but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.</p>

			<p><mark>A skill is the learned or innate  ability to act with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time, energy, or both</mark>. Skills can often<sup>[quantify]</sup> be divided into <sub>domain-general</sub> and <sub>domain-specific skills</sub>. Some examples of general skills include time management, teamwork and leadership, and self-motivation. In contrast, domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job, e.g. operating a sand blaster. Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.</p>
